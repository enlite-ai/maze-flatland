    Observation builders are Flatland's approach to make the complexity of the environment more manageable by adding a

    this is not necessary, but can be helpful. When deciding whether to build an ObservationBuilder (OB) or to implement
    the extraction of information directly in FlatlandMazeState, consider that OBs can be helpful under one of the
    following conditions:
        - The extraction code is long and complex. OBs provide modularity and can make the code more readable.
        - There are several OBs available, some of them directly via the Flatland API. They can be used in a
          plug-and-play manner.
        - The information extraction code should not be run in all environment configurations, e.g. because it is
          costly. This can be reimplemented in FlatlandMazeState as well, but Maze' configuration abilities already
          offer a way to achieve this.
